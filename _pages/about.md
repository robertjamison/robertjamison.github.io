![A picture of the Jamisons, bonded by blood and common patriotism](/assets/images/jamisons.jpeg "The Jamisons")

Hiya, I'm Robert Jamison.  I created OnlyData as a place to record my personal discoveries while working in computer science and signals theory.  I documented my life via a written diary until I realized my life was already 100% online. By shifting to a blog-style diary, I'm sharing my life with other like-minded weirdos.  Hopefully, as I put myself out there, I'll inspire others to do the same.

Although I dedicate most of my time to work, I still enjoy some of the small things in life. My list of hobbies is a lot smaller now, but here's some of the activities I do on a yearly basis:
* Brewing honey wines, meads, and European coffee
* Hunting for real and fake wildlife
* Exploring the wilderness of foreign lands
* Cooking foods that I have no business eating
* Reading books about data analytics and signal theory
* Jogging for no more than two miles on a given day
* Testing First-person shooter video games
* Drawing birds outside my livingroom window
* Growing grass in my mudpit of a backyard
