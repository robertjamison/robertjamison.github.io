![A picture of the Jamisons, bonded by blood and common patriotism](/assets/images/jamisons.jpeg "The Jamisons")
Hiya, I'm Robert Jamison.  That's [my mom](https://jamisonfactor.com) and I in the picture above. She and I joined the Army about the same time in 2007, and ever since, I've been working with laptops, radios, and satellite terminals. I created OnlyData as a place to record my personal discoveries while working in computer science and signals theory.  I had been documenting my life via a written diary until one day I realized my life was already 100% online. By shifting to a blog-style diary, I hope to share my life lessons with other like-minded weirdos.  Hopefully (as I put myself out there) I'll inspire others to do the same.

Each day of the week, I post something different using a vignette:
1. Motivation Monday - Fascinating and mind-altering stories about important nobodies of history.
2. Twosday - Two different but similar concepts.  A true free-for-all.
3. Wacky Wednesday - Something odd that happened during this week long ago.
4. Threat Thursday - Malicious cyber and signal actors of interest.
5. Fast-Fact Friday - A short and sweet truth.
6. Sojourner Saturday - A guest author writes because I'm only creative enough for six days a week.
7. Science Sunday - In-depth computer science concepts based on what I'm researching that week.

Although I dedicate most of my time to work, I still enjoy some of the small things in life. My list of hobbies is a lot smaller now, but here's some of the activities I do on a yearly basis:
* Brewing honey wines, meads, and European coffee
* Hunting for real and fake wildlife
* Exploring the wilderness of foreign lands
* Cooking foods that I have no business eating
* Reading books about data analytics and signal theory
* Jogging for no more than two miles on a given day
* Testing First-person shooter video games
* Drawing birds outside my livingroom window
* Growing grass in my mudpit of a backyard
